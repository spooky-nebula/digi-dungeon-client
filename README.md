# Digi Dungeon Client

This is the Official client for connecting to Digi Dungeon Servers. You can use this client as an example on how to create your own client!

# Building on your PC

The project is built on Electron so you need NPM and Node.js (which are often bundled). This client was made in Linux but it is cross-platform so hopefully you can just run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
