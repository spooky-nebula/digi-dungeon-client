Hey, remember when I wanted to show you the app I was making because you wanted to see my UX/UI and it wasn't working? Yeah I remembered that it was because there was a mountain I had to climb with 5 monkeys throwing rocks at me while the uphill was full of oil and I had sandals with socks on. There was an unfixable bug, or I thought it was, that took hours of banging my face against the screen to fix but, finally, I fixed it, so now I can screenshot my shit UI, here's it.
